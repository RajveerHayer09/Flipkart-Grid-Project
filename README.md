# Use-cases #
1.Virtual Try-On: Users can visualize products on a similar human as them before purchasing, enhancing confidence in buying clothing, accessories, and beauty items.Thishelpstoremove the conventional idea of product images where only a single model(human) is wearing every kind of product irrespective of the customer.
2. Personalized Suggestions: AI recommends products based on user input, providing tailored shopping options aligned with preferences also using the history of the prompts.
3. Trend Exploration: AI-generated content keeps users informed about the latest fashion trends and styles.
4. Related products : User gets a list of products which are related to the search prompt of the user.


 # Solution statement/ Proposed approach #
Our platform caters to users seeking specific products for purchase. Users simply input the type of product they intend to buy. Notably, our website goes beyond this by providing an immersive experience where users can visualize how the chosen product appears on a person prior to making a purchase. This unique feature, achieved through the collaboration of generative AI technology and real-world product integration, adds a layer of confidence to the shopping process. With the assistance of our advanced AI capabilities, users can expect an enhanced and dynamic shopping journey that offers not only the products they desire but also the opportunity to preview them in real-world contexts.
Information about the search: It is possible that the user is unaware of the fashion trend and wants to know more about a trend which he searched for. Here user can ask the AI to generate images of the current trends and also generate text which helps the user to gain knowledge about that fashion trend.

# Future Scope #
1. We are in the process of enhancing the contextual information provided by users in their prompts.
2. Gen-AI models specific to our organization can be used for better image generation and text generation.
3.Theuseof browsing history to show reccomended products and generated fashion images can be improved.
4. Number of outfit images can be increased.
5.The response time can be decreased.
